# Next_Word_Predictor-LSTM
 Focuses on predicting the next word in a sequence of text. Data preprocessing, cleaning, and converting text to numbers for creating a supervised problem. The model is developed using the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithm with multiple layers to achieve accurate next word prediction.
